# Falling Letter Game
A simple game created with Vanilla JavaScript where letters fall from the sky. You must click or type the letters before they fall into the flames. If you don't get the letters before they fall, they will combust and you will lose points. Clicking letters garners more points than typing them, and you obtain more points the smaller the letters are.
